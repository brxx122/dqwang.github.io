## Welcome to My HomePage !

I am a full-time employee working at ByteDance AI Lab. Before that, I obtained my Master and Bachelor degrees in Computer Science from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/). I was a member of [Fudan NLP Group](https://nlp.fudan.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Xipeng Qiu](https://xpqiu.github.io/en.html) and [Prof. Xuanjing Huang](https://nlp.fudan.edu.cn/28702/list.htm).
My research focuses on Natural Language Processing, especially text summarization. I am also interested in AI methods for drug design.
