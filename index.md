## <em>About Me</em>

I am now pursuing my Ph.D. degree at LTI in Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), advised by [Prof. Lei Li](https://lileicc.github.io/). Before that I studies in UC Santa Barbara as a PhD student as a member of [UCSB NLP Group](https://nlp.cs.ucsb.edu/). I was a full-time researcher of ByteDance AI Lab and closely worked with [Jiaze Chen](https://cn.linkedin.com/in/jiaze-chen-00ab2681) and [Hao Zhou](https://zhouh.github.io/).
I obtained my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science from Fudan University and was a member of [Fudan NLP Group](https://nlp.fudan.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Xipeng Qiu](https://xpqiu.github.io/en.html) and [Prof. Xuanjing Huang](https://nlp.fudan.edu.cn/28702/list.htm).
My research focuses on **Strategic Planning of Large Language Models**, especially Multi-agent Cooperation. I am also interested in **AI for Science**, such as AI-assisted Drug Discovery.
